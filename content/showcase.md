We are searching for new screenshots to showcase Dunst's features.
It would be great if they used new features, such as color gradients
(`highlight` can receive a list of colors) or custom rounded corners (`corners`, `progress_bar_corners` and `icon_corners`).

To learn more and share your riced configuration see [#826](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst/issues/826).
