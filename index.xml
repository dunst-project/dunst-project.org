      <description>Common problems Errors about missing or failing to open a display Depending on the setup dunst was unable to connect to the X server or the wayland compositor in use. In case of X make sure that X is running and that the DISPLAY environment variable is correctly set. For a wayland based setup the WAYLAND_DISPLAY environment variable needs to be set to a valid value.
If dunst should be automatically started by dbus or via the systemd service, it is important to know that both don&amp;rsquo;t inherit environment variables set by a shell.</description>

      <description>Dunst changelog 1.9.0 &amp;ndash; 2022-06-27 Added override_dbus_timeout setting to override the notification timeout set via dbus. (#1035) Support notification gaps via the gap_size setting. Note that since the notifications are not separate windows, you cannot click in between the notifications. (#1053) Make min_icon_size and max_icon_size a rule for even more flexibility (#1069) Changed The window offset is now scaled according to scale as well. This way notification stay visually in the same place on higher DPI screens.</description>
