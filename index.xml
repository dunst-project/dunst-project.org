      <description>NAME DESCRIPTION  Global section Urgency sections   DUNSTCTL HISTORY WAYLAND RULES  SCRIPTING   COLORS  NOTIFY-SEND   ACTIONS TIME FORMAT AUTHORS REPORTING BUGS COPYRIGHT SEE ALSO  NAME dunst - configuration file
DESCRIPTION The configuration is divided into sections in an ini-like format. Every section start with the section&amp;#39;s name in square brackets. After that is a list of key-value pairs that specify the settings. Whitespace is purely cosmetic and doesn&amp;#39;t matter for the result.</description>

      <description>Common problems Errors about missing or failing to open a display Depending on the setup dunst was unable to connect to the X server or the wayland compositor in use. In case of X make sure that X is running and that the DISPLAY environment variable is correctly set. For a wayland based setup the WAYLAND_DISPLAY environment variable needs to be set to a valid value.
If dunst should be automatically started by dbus or via the systemd service, it is important to know that both don&amp;rsquo;t inherit environment variables set by a shell.</description>
